In this page, we will quickly skim through the core datatypes, which will be 
covered in more detail in later pages.

## `Relation`

A value of type `Relation[A, B]` is a simple declaration that a value of type 
`A` is tied to a value of type `B`.

See the [Relations](/guide/defining-relations.md) page for more details.

## `Access`

The type `Access[A]` is a placeholder for datatypes that will provide the monadic
context of evaluation.

Simply put, it's a placeholder that gets substituted for `ZQuery`, `Fetch`, `Gen`.

## `Proof`





## `ReifiedRelation`
