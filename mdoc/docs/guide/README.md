# Introduction

## Welcome

decrel is an open-source Scala library that allows developers to 

- define relations between their domain data models, and 
- compose those relations into queries, that can
  - run against a datasource, or 
  - generate values. 

With decrel, you can define relations between your data models using a simple, intuitive syntax, and then use those relations to generate random but consistent data or to describe queries in a declarative way. The library is designed to be easy to use and integrate into your existing codebase, allowing you to quickly and efficiently work with complex data models and queries.

This documentation site provides comprehensive information on how to use decrel, from installation to advanced usage. Whether you're new to decrel or an experienced user, you'll find everything you need to know to get the most out of this powerful library.

So, let's get started and explore how decrel can simplify your data manipulation and query construction in Scala!
